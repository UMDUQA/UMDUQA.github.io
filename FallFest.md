title: UQA x IBM Qiskit Fall Fest 2022
---

[IBM Qiskit Fall Fest](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest/) is a series of Quantum Computing events organized by students and sponsored by IBM Quantum. As part of the 2022 Fall Fest, the [Undergraduate Quantum Association](https://umdphysics.umd.edu/academics/ugrad-student-opportunities/undergraduate-quantum-association.html) is hosting a weekend full of quantum programming, workshops, speakers, and more! Come work on quantum computing challenges with others. No prior experience necessary! 

UQA Fall Fest is going to take place Friday to Sunday, October 28th - 30th, in-person, on-campus at the University of Maryland.

# Goal
The goal of the Undergraduate Quantum Association Fall Fest is to create a community that learns quantum computing together by completing the Qiskit Jupyter notebooks presented in the IBM Quantum Explorer program. UQA Fall Fest is creating a space for everyone interested in working on these notebooks as a team. Prizes will be given for groups that finish the most notebooks! To support you while working, UQA is providing Qiskit workshops, mentorship, snacks and meals!
